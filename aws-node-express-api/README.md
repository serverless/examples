# Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Node Express API service running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.

This template configures a single function, `api`, which is responsible for handling all incoming requests using the `httpApi` event. To learn more about `httpApi` event configuration options, please refer to [httpApi event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/). As the event is configured in a way to accept all incoming requests, the Express.js framework is responsible for routing and handling requests internally. This implementation uses the `serverless-http` package to transform the incoming event request payloads to payloads compatible with Express.js. To learn more about `serverless-http`, please refer to the [serverless-http README](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http).

## Usage

### Deployment

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and then deploy with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-node-express-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

✔ Service deployed to stack aws-node-express-api-dev (96s)

endpoint: ANY - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
functions:
  api: aws-node-express-api-dev-api (2.3 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [`httpApi` event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{ "message": "Hello from root!" }
```

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the `dev` command:

```bash
serverless dev
```

Dev Mode attaches your deployed function to your machine: call your API as before, and your local code runs, with your function's deployed configuration and permissions. Edit the code and the next request runs the new version, with nothing to redeploy.

Press Ctrl+C to end the session; your function runs the deployed code again. Deploy with `serverless deploy` when you want your changes to stay. Learn more in the [Dev Mode guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/dev-mode).
